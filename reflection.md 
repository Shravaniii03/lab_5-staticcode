1. Which issues were easiest/hardest to fix?
The easiest fixes were formatting and unused variables flagged by Flake8. The hardest was dealing with mutable default arguments because it required understanding Python’s function behavior and modifying logic safely.

2. False Positives:
Bandit flagged a “possible use of eval()” that was actually part of a safe data parsing routine. After review, this was a false positive as the input was strictly sanitized.

3. Integration into Workflow:
These tools can be added to GitHub Actions CI pipeline to automatically analyze code on each push or pull request. Developers can also run them locally before committing changes.

4. Tangible Improvements:
After applying the fixes, the code became more consistent, readable, and secure. Potential runtime errors and security vulnerabilities were eliminated, and the Pylint score reflected higher code quality.
